This repository provides a set of scripts to make it really easy to deploy an LDAP-backed Shibboleth Identity Provider and Discovery Service on a Ubuntu 12.04 LTS machine.  It is mainly intended to provide those developing an application that uses Shibboleth as a Service Provider, a test harness to ensure the application with work with Shibboleth before deploying it on a live server and registering it with the Discovery Service provided by a proper Access Management Federation (e.g. UK Access Management Federation).

Currently (as of 13th May 2013) there have been a number of simplification made to save effort.  Most notably not setting up a trust engine for the Discovery Service to save the effort of having to create further self-signed certificates and pass them around.  However, it should be fairly straightforward to build on the current installer to add pieces of configuration that have currently been deliberately overlooked.

This work was undertaken in support the NeuroHub project (http://www.neurohub.ac.uk/).

The installation scripts for the Shibboleth Identity Provider and Discovery Service have been updated from various guides provided by the main Shibboleth wiki (https://wiki.shibboleth.net/), SWITCH (http://www.switch.ch/aai/about/shibboleth/index.html) and the UK Access Management Federation (http://www.ukfederation.org.uk/).

To simplify the adding, modification and deletion of inetOrgPerson accounts on the LDAP server, the LDAP scripts created by Ganael Laplanche (see https://sourceforge.net/projects/ldapscripts/) have been adapted to create inetOrgPerson accounts rather than POSIX user accounts.
