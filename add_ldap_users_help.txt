--------------------------------------------------------------------

The following commands will need to be run as root or with sudo as the commands need to access the LDAP server password file.

1. Add a group:

  ldapaddgroup testgroup


2. Then add a user to that group:

  ldapadduser testuser1 testgroup


3. Then set that users password:

  ldapsetpasswd testuser1

Enter password and password confirmation when prompted.
